# What's GenoSpark about?

**GenoSpark** is a tool that queries the population genetic frequency of three major ethnics in Singapore 
on a Apache Spark framework running on top of Hadoop (Distributed filesystem). The current version of GenoSpark (v1.0, October 2017) 
has a separate local SQLite version (i.e. Job performed on the usual local filesystem).
